% Selection Problem; 
% Objective 1: Number of Selected Features (between 0 and 1)
% Objective 2: Weighted Sum of Train Error and Test Error)

% SelectedFeatures: Binary Vector (0s and 1s) Indicating Selected Features
% e.g.,: SelectedFeatures = [1 0 1]: first and third features were selected

% Extracting Selecting Features
InputSelected = Data.Input(S,:);

% Ratio of Selected Features
