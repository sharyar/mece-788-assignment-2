function [Pop, F] = SortPopulation(Pop)
% Function Sorts Pop Members Based on Crowding Distance and Rank 


% Sorting Based on Crowding Distance
[~, CDSortOrder] = sort([Pop.CrowdingDistance], 'descend');
Pop = Pop(CDSortOrder);

% Sorting Based on Rank
[~, RSortOrder] = sort([Pop.Rank]);

% Updating All Fronts
Ranks = [Pop.Rank];

% Maximum Rank Determines Number of Fronts

% Assign Solutions with Rank r to Front r
for r = 1:MaximumRank
